    title: Shader Techniques
    textInfo: This island scene has no lights. The textures are created through a
      variety of shaders and image effects. For instance, in the shaders, gradients
      are created based on the depth of each pixel in the scene, or their orientation
      from top to bottom, left to right, or up and down. A camera depth texture is
      passed to the ocean shader, creating the illusion that you can see partially
      through the water, without any physically based transparency rendering at all.
      This scene is one of the demos that comes with Marvelous Techniques, available
      in the Asset Store. While these techniques are used on all platforms (notably,
      in the game Monument Valley), VR especially benefits from the reduction of CPU
      load by eliminating real-time lights.

    title: VR Painting
    textInfo: The promotional video for Google Tiltbrush gives you a taste of how
      exciting it is to paint in a truly 3 dimensional space on high end headsets
      like the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. Studios are also starting to use Tiltbrush
      to make quick prototypes for VR apps. The second part of this video shows part
      of a prototype, painted in Tiltbrush, for Project Super by Dream On VR.
